# Emacs Configuration

Jessica Hamrick  
jhamrick@berkeley.edu

**Tested on versions:**
* GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0, NS apple-appkit-1265.19) of 2014-04-06
* GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.4.2) of 2014-02-22

## Installing

Clone this repository directly as your `~/.emacs.d`.
```
git clone https://github.com/jhamrick/emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Once you have cloned this repository, start Emacs (make sure you are
connected to the internet when you do this for the first time). It
will install [`el-get`](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) and all of
the other plugins listed in the next section. This initial
installation may take a while, so be patient.

## Dependencies

For some of the plugins to work, you will need to have some external
dependencies installed, such as Python, IPython, git, etc. If the
installation gives you an error, it might mean you are missing a
required dependency that el-get doesn't install.

## Emacs plugins

This configuration installs several plugins using
[`el-get`](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get). These plugins are
specified in `.emacs.d/settings/el-get-settings.el`, and are also
listed below:

* `auctex` -- LaTeX plugin
* `ein` -- [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook) plugin
* `jedi` -- general Python support
* `pydoc-info` -- Python documentation
* `auto-complete` -- auto completion
* `popup` -- visual popup (e.g., for auto completion)
* `color-theme-solarized` -- the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme
* `magit` -- git plugin
* `markdown-mode` -- support for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files
* `matlab-mode` -- support Matlab files
* `nxhtml` (MuMaMo)
* `scss-mode` -- support for [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) files
* `nyan-mode` -- silly mode that renders a nyan cat to display how far
  you are through a file
* `helm` -- [completion and selection](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) narrowing framework
* `helm-descbinds` -- describe keybindings using helm
* `yaml-mode` -- support [YAML](https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode) files

## Gotchas

Here are some issues I or others have run into when installing this configuration.

### Version control systems

To install all the plugins above, you need to have several different version control systems installed, including `hg`, `git`, `bzr`, and `cvs`.

### Trouble building AUCTeX

If you get the following error:

`error: el-get: ./autogen.sh el-get could not build auctex [./autogen.sh]`

There are a few possible causes. Try these steps:

1. Make sure you have `automake` and `texlive-full` installed (if you are on Ubuntu) or MacTeX (if you are on Mac).
2. Try running emacs from the command line (it could be an issue with not finding the right path).
3. If that doesn't work, run emacs from the command line with the `--debug-init` flag. This will give you more information about the error, and possibly point you towards the solution.

### No such file or directory: pycheckers

`pycheckers` is a little script to check that your Python code
conforms to the
[PEP8 style guide](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) using
the [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) and
[pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes/0.8.1) Python
packages.

If you do not want this functionality, you can comment out the block
of code in `python-settings.el` that starts with "pyflakes flymake
integration". Otherwise, read on.

1. In your `~/.bashrc`, add `$HOME/bin` to your `$PATH` environment variable like so:
  
  ```
  export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
  ```

2. Create a file in `~/bin/pycheckers` with the following contents:

  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  
  pyflakes "$1"
  pep8 --ignore=E261 --repeat "$1"
  true
  ```

3. Make it executable with `chmod +x ~/bin/pycheckers`.

4. Make sure you have `pep8` and `pyflakes` installed (run `pip
   install pep8 pyflakes`).

5. Now it should work! If not, please submit a bug report and let me
   know.

### Tramp is timing out

If you get the error `tramp ssh: connect to host c port 22: Operation timed out` and you are running OS X Mavericks with Emacs installed using Homebrew, then this is probably due to the Mavericks upgrade. Try reinstalling Emacs through Homebrew and remove the folder `~/.emacs.d/el-get` (note: this will remove all your el-get plugins, and they will need to be reinstalled).
